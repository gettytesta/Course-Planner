# Course-Planner

SPECIFICATIONS
1. Write a fully-documented class named Course which contains the course name (String), department (String), code (int), section (byte), and instructor (String). You should provide accessor and mutator methods for each variable. The mutator methods for code and section should throw an appropriate exception for invalid values (e.g. a negative value). Also, include a constructor for the class, as well as the clone() and equals() methods. The full list of required methods is:

public Course - constructor (you may include a constructor with parameters)
getter/setter methods for each variable
public Object clone() - the return value is a copy of this Course. Subsequent changes to the copy will not affect the original and vice versa. Note that the return value must be typecasted to a Course before it can be used.
public boolean equals(Object obj) - a return value of true indicates that obj refers to a Course object with the same attributes as this Course. Otherwise, the return value is false.
2. Write a fully-documented class named Planner which stores an ordered list of Course objects. The array indices determine the preference of the courses (do not use ArrayList, Vector, or any other Java API Data Structures). A student can insert a course at any position within the range of the list. Make sure there are no gaps between courses on the list. Note that arrays in Java are 0 indexed, but your listing preference should start from 1. The Planner can record a total of 50 courses, so use the final variable MAX_COURSES = 50 (and refrain from using the number 50 within your code). The class will be based on the following ADT specification:

public class Planner
The Planner class implements an abstract data type for a list of courses supporting some common operations on such lists.

public Planner
Constructs an instance of the Planner with no Course objects in it.
Postcondition:
This Planner has been initialized to an empty list of Courses.

public int size()
Determines the number of courses currently in the list.
Preconditions:
This Planner has been instatiated.
Returns:
The number of Courses in this Planner.

public void addCourse(Course newCourse, int position)
Parameters:
newCourse - the new course to add to the list
position - the position (preference) of this course on the list
Preconditions:
This Course object has been instantiated and 1 ≤ position ≤ items_currently_in_list + 1. The number of Course objects in this Planner is less than MAX_COURSES.
Postconditions:
The new Course is now listed in the correct preference on the list. All Courses that were originally greater than or equal to position are moved back one position. (e.g. If there are 5 Courses in a Planner, positioned 1-5, and you insert a Course in position 4, the new Course would be placed in position 4, the Course that was in position 4 will be moved to position 5, and the Course that was in position 5 will be moved to position 6.)
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
Indicates that position is not within the valid range.
FullPlannerExpcetion
Indicates that there is no more room in the Planner to record an additional Course.
Note 1:
position refers to the position in the Planner and not the position in the array.
Note 2:
Inserting an item in position (items_currently_in_list + 1) is effectively the same as adding the item to the end of the list.

public void addCourse(Course newCourse)
Works just like public void addCourse(Course newCourse, int position), except adds to the end of the list.
Note:
This method can be written in one line using the addCourse() and size() methods above.

public void removeCourse(int position)
Parameters:
position - the position in the Planner where the Course will be removed from.
Preconditions:
This Planner has been instantiated and 1 ≤ position ≤ items_currently_in_list.
Postconditions:
The Course at the desired position has been removed. All Courses that were originally greater than or equal to position are moved backward one position. (e.g. If there are 5 Courses in a Planner, positioned 1-5, and you remove the Course in position 4, the item that was in position 5 will be moved to position 4.)
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
Indicates that position is not within the valid range.
Note:
position refers to the position in the Planner and not the position in the array.

public Course getCourse(int position)
Parameters:
position - position of the Course to retrieve.
Preconditions:
The Planner object has been instantiated and 1 ≤ position ≤ items_currenyly_in_list.
Returns:
The Course at the specified position in this Planner object.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
Indicates that position is not within the valid range.
Note:
position refers to the position in the Planner and not the position in the array.

public static void filter(Planner planner, String department)
Prints all Courses that are within the specified department.
Parameters:
planner - the list of courses to search in
department - the 3 letter department code for a Course
Preconditions:
This Planner object has been instantiated.
Postconditions:
Displays a neatly formatted table of each course filtered from the Planner. Keep the preference numbers the same.

public boolean exists(Course course)
Checks whether a certain Course is already in the list.
Parameters:
course - the Course we are looking for
Preconditions:
This Planner and Course has both been instantiated.
Returns:
True if the Planner contains this Course, false otherwise.

public Object clone()
Creates a copy of this Planner. Subsequent changes to the copy will not affect the original and vice versa.
Preconditions:
This Planner object has been instantiated.
Returns:
A copy (backup) of this Planner object.

public void printAllCourses()
Prints a neatly formatted table of each item in the list with its position number as shown in the sample output.
Preconditions:
This Planner has been instantiated.
Postconditions:
Displats a neatly formatted table of each course from the Planner.
Hint: If your toString() method is implemented correctly as described below, you will simply need to call it and print the results to the user.

public String toString()
Gets the String representation of this Planner object, which is a neatly formatted table of each Course in the Planner on its own line with its position number as shown in the sample output.
Returns:
The String representation of this Planner object.
3. Write a fully-documented class named PlannerManager that is based on the following specification:

public class PlannerManager

public static void main(String[] args)
The main method runs a menu driven application which first creates an empty Planner object. The program prompts the user for a command to execute an operation. Once a command has been chosen, the program may ask the user for additional information if necessary, and performs the operation. The operations should be defined as follows:

A - Add Course
Adds a new course into the list.
G - Get Course
Displays information of a Course at the given position.
R - Remove Course
Removes the Course at the given position.
P - Print Courses in Planner
Displays all courses in the list.
F - Filter By Department Code
Displays courses that match the given department code.
L - Look For Course
Determines whether the course with the given attributes is in the list.
S - Size
Determines the number of courses in the Planner.
B - Backup
Creates a copy of the given Planner. Changes to the copy will not affect the original and vice versa.
PB - Print Courses in Backup
Displays all the courses from the backed-up list.
RB - Revert to Backup
Reverts the current Planner to the backed up copy.
Q - Quit
Terminates the program.
4. You will need classes to handle the exceptions thrown (see class specifications above for exception classes you need).
